# Ethereum-From-Scratch
A collection of resources I found useful while learning Ethereum from scratch.

I have compiled the resources in an order that I think would help new learners the most (but it's obviously an opinionated list).

Pull requests and resource recommendations are welcome!

## Blockchain Basics

These two videos are the best introductions I have found to core blockchain concepts and are presented extremely well

- [Blockchain 101 - Visual Introduction to Blockchain - Anders Brownworth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8)
- [Blockchain 101 - Part 2 - Anders Brownworth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIDL_akeras)

## Cryptography

- [Elliptic Curve Cryptography - Jimy Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6voIwB-An4)

## Ethereum Internals

- [What is an Ethereum Keystore File](https://medium.com/@julien.maffre/what-is-an-ethereum-keystore-file-86c8c5917b97)
